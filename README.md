# [Full Stack Open 2021](https://fullstackopen.com/en/ "Full Stack Open 2021 Homepage")

This course by the University of Helsinki is an introduction to modern web
development with JavaScript. The focus is on single page applications
implemented with React and supported with RESTful and GraphQL web services
implemented with Node.js. New material on TypeScript is included in the 2021
edition. Other topics include debugging applications, configuration, and
managing runtime environments and NoSQL databases.

This repo contains my submissions to the 2021 course exercises.
